# voxelmorph-pytorch
**Preliminary** version of pytorch.

**Important note:** we will soon be updating a new **voxelmorph** version that will integrate both `keras/tensorflow` and `pytorch` versions.  
Special thanks to Guha Balakrishnan and Victor Butoi to getting this version together quickly. 

## Training

We designed the scripts to be as similar as possible to the `tensorflow/keras` versions. 

```
train.py --data_dir /my/path/to/data --gpu 0 --model_dir /my/path/to/save/models 
```


# Contact:
For any problems or questions please [open an issue](https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph/issues/new?labels=voxelmorph) in github. Please note that this is a preliminary `pytorch` version, and has not been tested and developed as thoroughly as the `keras` version.
